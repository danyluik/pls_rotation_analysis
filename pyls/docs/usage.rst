Partial least squares (PLS) is a multivariate statistical technique that aims
to find shared information between two sets of variables. If you're unfamiliar
with PLS and are interested in a thorough (albeit quite technical) treatment,
`Abdi et al., 2013 <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-059-5_23>`_ is a good
resource.

This user guide will go through the basic statistical concepts of the two types
of PLS implemented in the current package (:ref:`usage_behavioral` and
:ref:`usage_meancentered`) and demonstrate how to interpret and use the results
of a PLS analysis (:ref:`usage_results`). If you still have questions after
going through this guide then you can refer to the :ref:`ref_api`!
